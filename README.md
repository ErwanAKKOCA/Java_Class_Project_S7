## Before start

_In each file do not forget to change path name in case, for example:
"FISE_2024_2025_Dungeon_Crawler-master/img/heroTileSheetLowResEnemyfreezed.png"_

## Proposed features:

When the character dies, a screen indicates the game over, this happens when lives number is below 0. A health bar indicates the number of lives, and decreases when the hero get damaged.


Do not go near this static guy, or you will loose 1 life. Better stay away, as soon as you are 100 pixels away from him it will be ok.

Using [SPACE] Keyboard, cast a very freezing spell near somebody, icy mountains grow very fast. Last 2 secondes, cooldown of 4 seconds. Beware! It is very exaustive, cost 1 life.
